## Real Work:
  1. function for excuting instructions
  * as know now instructions are loaded in the mem, so what we need to do now is the next stage of actually excuting it *
  #### the following is need:
    - extract opcode 
    - based on opcode run on of the 11 functions for each instruction
    - well now we can either path it to the function and the function does its job by finding numbers or we can do it outside which is going to be handy but as a matter of fact this not th beiggest differenet 
    - finishing all functions for it's inst (eg.void ADD() = "do what add is going to do")
